## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?

a. Why is timely delivery crucial
By meeting the deadlines, clients can be sure to get the required product at the promised time which increases their trust and satisfaction. Meeting deadlines enables companies to remain competitors by bringing their product to market earlier than or simultaneously with rivals. Delays usually incur higher costs, whether from extended labour and resource use or penalties. Timely execution allows for resources to be allocated towards other projects, preventing situations of backlog and inefficiency. Meeting deadlines in a consistent manner continually builds up the company’s reputation that attracts more work and high caliber talent.

b. Ensuring deadlines are met
A detailed project plan needs to include specific milestones together with strict timeframes. Gantt charts serve as tools which help you see how your work progresses. All team members and stakeholders should maintain regular communication to share information and remain simultaneously aware of everything. You should distribute resources appropriately to provide necessary personnel and equipment when requirements emerge. Generate an early detection of possible risks followed by the creation of proactive mitigation strategies to respond to them. You should monitor project progress regularly by comparing it to the plan and apply necessary modifications. Project management software tools should be used to facilitate this process. When using agile practices with Scrum or Kanban teams can benefit from adaptive working methods to achieve incremental development while adapting to sudden changes. Enable teams to resolve issues while maintaining decision-making power because this builds responsibility as well as employee participation. Involving stakeholders continuously from start to finish ensures their requirements remain operational throughout the duration of the project.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
a. Contributing to success
The project budget acts as a protective measure which maintains allocated funds for other business operations. Fiscal stability for the company remains secure through proper cost control measures which prevent financial burdens from surprise expenses. When funds are used efficiently it enables organizations to direct resources better thus achieving enhanced productivity and output measurements. The successful execution of projects using their approved budget builds trust between clients and leads to their satisfaction. Project profitability improves when budget overruns are prevented because it maintains project cost stability. Businesses can detect monetary risks in a timely manner and develop immediate solutions using effective cost control measures.

b. Strategies to prevent budget overruns
Create an extensive budget strategy which will evaluate complete project elements along with probable unexpected situations. The organization needs to track its costs both periodically and on schedule to verify that expenses remain inside their budget allocations. Project management software should be used to track operational costs while simultaneously offering real-time budget performance updates to stakeholders. Project scope definition should be detailed while scope creep must be prevented because it generates additional unexpected costs. The organization should work with vendors through negotiations to get better prices along with reliable service timelines for their materials and services. Strategic resource deployment should aim to prevent both the excessive use of team members and tools and situations where members have insufficient resources. Develop a set of actions ahead of time to minimize possible cost dilemmas when they first emerge. A project needs strong change management systems that enable proper handling of changes affecting project scope, schedule and budget elements. Budget reviews must happen at regular intervals for identifying budget deviations so immediate corrective actions can be put into place. Training project team members about key cost management concepts must include sessions showing their responsibility to honor the restated budget.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
